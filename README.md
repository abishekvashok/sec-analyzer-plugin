# sec-analyzer-plugin
A chrome extension that casually mentions about possible security issues in websites you visit

Sidenote: Remember, the extension is nowhere near perfect and might have high noise for certain detections. I will try to quail it one day, but I can't make promises :)

Further sidenote: There is no intention on my part ot publish this to Google Chrome
extension store or whatever it is called. I make no guaranteed support
for this project as well.
